# rubyJeykllSetup
Bash script to setup Jekyll

Designed for Mac OSX but should be compatible with most flavors of Linux.

Basic usage is run using "bash jekyllSetup.sh"

There are two methods of setup, Default and Custom.

Default setup uses the system ruby and adds the jekyll gem to the ruby environment there.

Custom setup uses rbenv and allows a customized configuration, however this setup is very Do-It-Yourself, and for most uses, the default installation will be sufficient.
